💖 Happy Girlfriend Day 💖
On this special day, I just want to say how lucky I am to have you in my life.

Your smile lights up my world, your voice calms my soul, and your love makes every moment magical.

You're not just my girlfriend — you're my best friend, my biggest support, my forever person.

Thank you for loving me, caring for me, and making me feel like the most special person on Earth.

I promise to always stand by your side, through every laugh, every tear, every dream.

You are my today, my tomorrow, and my always.

❤️ Yours forever — Kabir
